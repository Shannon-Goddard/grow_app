      Hey there, green thumbs! This Disclaimer covers our website (<a href="https://growappcannabis.guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">growappcannabis.guide</a>), our app (GrowApp - Cannabis Guide), and our cannabis-themed games (like <em>Go Toke!</em> or <em>No Fish!</em>), collectively the “Service.” We’re Loyal9 LLC, and we’re here to help you grow cannabis responsibly, but we’ve got a few things to clear up to keep things chill and legal. Check out our <a href="https://www.loyal9.app/tools/contact-us/assets/policies/terms-of-use.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="https://www.loyal9.app/tools/contact-us/assets/policies/privacy-policy.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> for the full scoop.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Who We Are</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Loyal9 LLC is a California-based company in Adelanto, CA. The Service is intended for users 21 and older for cannabis cultivation purposes.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Affiliate Links</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Most links in our shop (e.g., to Amazon, Seed Supreme, Seedsman) are affiliate links. If you click one, find something you love, and buy it, we might earn a small commission—at no extra cost to you! These third parties handle their own transactions, and we’re not responsible for their products, services, or policies. Check their terms before buying.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Cannabis Compliance</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      The Service provides tools (e.g., MyGrow, Plant Doctor) and games for cannabis cultivation and fun where it’s legal. You’re responsible for following local, state, and federal laws—heads up, cannabis is still illegal under U.S. federal law. The Service is for users 21 and older, and it’s not intended for use in jurisdictions where cannabis cultivation is prohibited.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">No Medical Advice</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      The info on our Service (e.g., strain details, Plant Doctor videos) is for educational purposes only. It’s not medical advice, and we’re not doctors. Always consult a professional for health or cannabis-related advice. Loyal9 LLC isn’t liable for any decisions you make based on our content.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">No Warranties</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      The Service is provided “AS IS” with no warranties. We don’t guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or availability of our content (e.g., strain info, grow guides). Your use is at your own risk, and we’re not responsible for any issues, like errors in MyGrow data you store locally or problems with third-party purchases.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Limitation of Liability</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      To the fullest extent allowed by law, Loyal9 LLC and its suppliers aren’t liable for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Damages from using or not being able to use the Service.</li>
      <li>Inaccuracies or errors in our content or tools.</li>
      <li>Third-party actions (e.g., affiliate purchases, app store issues).</li>
      <li>Loss of data you enter (e.g., MyDiary notes), which is stored on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Our total liability is $0.00, as you don’t pay us directly. Some jurisdictions don’t allow these limits, so they’ll apply to the extent permitted.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Third-Party Services</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Beyond affiliate links, the Service may connect to third parties (e.g., App Store, Google Play, social media). We’re not responsible for their content, services, or policies. Review their terms before engaging.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Changes to This Disclaimer</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      We may update this Disclaimer if our practices change. We’ll notify you via email or a notice on the Service. Check back periodically for updates.
