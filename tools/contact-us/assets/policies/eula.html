    <h1 data-custom-class="title">End-User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="subtitle">Last updated: April 18, 2025</p>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Welcome to Loyal9 LLC! This End-User License Agreement (“EULA”) governs your use of our mobile applications, including GrowApp - Cannabis Guide (available on App Store, Google Play, and Amazon AppStore) and our cannabis-themed games (e.g., <em>Go Toke!</em>, <em>No Fish!</em>) on App Store and Google Play (collectively, the “Apps”). By downloading or using the Apps, you agree to this EULA. If you don’t agree, please don’t download or use the Apps.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Who We Are</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      “We,” “Us,” or “Our” refers to Loyal9 LLC, a California-based company located in Adelanto, CA. The Apps provide tools and games for cannabis cultivation and entertainment.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">License Grant</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Apps on your device for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to this EULA. The Apps are licensed, not sold. You may not:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modify, reverse-engineer, or distribute the Apps.</li>
      <li>Use the Apps for illegal purposes or in violation of app store policies.</li>
      <li>Transfer the license to another person or device.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Your Responsibilities</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      You agree to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be at least 21 years old, as the Apps provide tools and information for cannabis cultivation.</li>
      <li>Use the Apps only where cannabis is legal under local, state, and federal laws (note: cannabis is illegal under U.S. federal law).</li>
      <li>Comply with the terms of the App Store, Google Play, or Amazon AppStore where you purchased the Apps.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">App Features and Data</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      GrowApp - Cannabis Guide offers tools like MyGrow and MyDiary, where data you enter (e.g., strain, nutrients) is stored locally on your device using localStorage or indexedDB. We don’t access or store this data. Games provide cannabis-themed entertainment. See our <a href="https://www.loyal9.app/tools/contact-us/assets/policies/privacy-policy.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> for details on data practices.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Third-Party Services</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      The Apps may include affiliate links (e.g., Amazon, Seed Supreme) or connect to app stores for purchases. These third parties have their own terms and privacy policies. We’re not responsible for their actions, products, or services. Review their terms before engaging.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Cannabis Compliance</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      The Apps provide tools and games for cannabis cultivation and entertainment where legal. They are not medical advice. You’re responsible for complying with all applicable laws. We’re not liable for your cannabis-related activities.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Intellectual Property</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      The Apps’ content, design, and code are © Loyal9 LLC, unless stated otherwise. Our code is open-source on GitHub, but you may not use our content for commercial purposes without permission. You retain rights to data you enter (e.g., MyGrow notes).
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">No Warranties</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      The Apps are provided “AS IS” without warranties. To the fullest extent allowed by law, Loyal9 LLC and its suppliers disclaim all warranties, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We don’t guarantee the Apps will be error-free, uninterrupted, or compatible with your device.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Limitation of Liability</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      To the fullest extent allowed by law, Loyal9 LLC and its suppliers aren’t liable for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Damages from using or not being able to use the Apps.</li>
      <li>Errors, inaccuracies, or interruptions in the Apps.</li>
      <li>Third-party actions (e.g., app store issues, affiliate links).</li>
      <li>Loss of data you enter (e.g., MyGrow inputs), which is stored on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Our total liability is limited to $0.00, as you purchase the Apps via app stores, not us. Some jurisdictions don’t allow these limits, so they’ll apply to the extent permitted.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Termination</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      This EULA remains in effect until terminated. We may suspend or terminate your license at any time, without notice, if you violate this EULA or for any reason. You may terminate by deleting the Apps. Upon termination, you must stop using and delete the Apps.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Governing Law</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      This EULA is governed by California law, excluding its conflict of law rules. Any disputes will be resolved in California courts, but you’re also subject to your local laws.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Dispute Resolution</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      If you have a concern, contact us at growapp@loyal9.app to resolve it informally. If we can’t resolve it, you agree to pursue claims in California courts.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Severability</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      If any part of this EULA is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect. We may waive a breach without waiving future breaches.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Changes to This EULA</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      We may update this EULA at any time. We’ll notify you via email or a notice in the Apps for material changes. Continued use after changes means you agree to them.
    </p>
