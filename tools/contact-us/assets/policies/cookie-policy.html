      Welcome to Loyal9 LLC! This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies on our website (<a href="https://growappcannabis.guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">growappcannabis.guide</a>), our app (GrowApp - Cannabis Guide), and our cannabis-themed games (e.g., <em>Go Toke!</em>, <em>No Fish!</em>), collectively called the “Service.” We’re all about helping you grow cannabis responsibly, and we use cookies to make the Service better. This policy is part of our <a href="https://www.loyal9.app/tools/contact-us/assets/policies/privacy-policy.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Who We Are</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      “We,” “Us,” or “Our” refers to Loyal9 LLC, a California-based company located in Adelanto, CA. The Service is intended for users 21 and older for cannabis cultivation purposes.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">What Are Cookies?</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Cookies are small text files stored on your device (e.g., phone, computer) when you visit our website or use our apps. They help us understand how the Service is used without identifying you personally.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Cookies We Use</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      We use Google Analytics cookies to collect non-personalized data, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>General location (e.g., country, city)</li>
      <li>Device type (e.g., phone, computer)</li>
      <li>Pages visited and time spent</li>
      <li>Browser type and operating system</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      These cookies are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Session Cookies</strong>: Temporary, deleted when you close your browser.</li>
      <li><strong>Persistent Cookies</strong>: Stay on your device (up to 14 months) to track usage over time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      In the future, growappcannabis.guide may use advertising cookies if we add ads (the app and games won’t have ads). We’ll update this policy if that happens.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Why We Use Cookies</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      We use cookies to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve the Service (e.g., fix bugs, optimize features).</li>
      <li>Analyze usage trends (e.g., which pages are popular).</li>
      <li>Plan for future ads on growappcannabis.guide.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Your Choices</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but this may affect some Service features (e.g., Analytics-driven improvements). To opt out of Google Analytics, use their <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">opt-out tool</a>. For future ad cookies, we’ll provide opt-out options if implemented.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Cannabis Compliance</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      The Service is for users 21 and older for cannabis cultivation purposes. Cookies don’t collect data about your cannabis use, only general usage stats. You’re responsible for complying with local, state, and federal laws (cannabis is illegal under U.S. federal law).
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Changes to This Policy</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      We may update this policy if our cookie practices change (e.g., adding ad cookies). We’ll notify you via email or a notice on the Service. Check back periodically for updates.
    </p>
