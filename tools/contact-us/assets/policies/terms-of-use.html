    <p data-custom-class="subtitle">Last updated: April 18, 2025</p>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Welcome to Loyal9 LLC! These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of our website (<a href="https://growappcannabis.guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">growappcannabis.guide</a>), our app (GrowApp - Cannabis Guide), and our cannabis-themed games (like <em>Go Toke!</em> or <em>No Fish!</em>), collectively called the “Service.” By using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you don’t agree, please don’t use the Service.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Who We Are</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      “We,” “Us,” or “Our” refers to Loyal9 LLC, a California-based company located in Adelanto, CA. The Service includes the GrowApp - Cannabis Guide website and app (available on App Store, Google Play, and Amazon AppStore) and games on App Store and Google Play.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Your Responsibilities</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      You agree to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be at least 21 years old, as the Service provides tools and information for cannabis cultivation.</li>
      <li>Use the Service only where cannabis is legal under local, state, and federal laws (note: cannabis is illegal under U.S. federal law).</li>
      <li>Not use the Service for illegal activities or to harm others.</li>
      <li>Not modify, reverse-engineer, or distribute the Service without permission.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">What We Provide</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      The Service offers tools like MyGrow, MyDiary, Plant Doctor, and affiliate links to third-party products (e.g., Amazon, Seed Supreme). We don’t sell products directly or process payments. Games are purchased via App Store or Google Play. All data you enter (e.g., MyGrow inputs) is stored locally on your device, not by us.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Third-Party Links and Services</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      The Service includes affiliate links and social media links. These third parties (e.g., Amazon, App Store) have their own terms and privacy policies. We’re not responsible for their actions, products, or services. Review their terms before purchasing or sharing info.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Intellectual Property</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      The Service’s content, design, and code are © Loyal9 LLC, unless stated otherwise. Our code is open-source on GitHub, but you may not use our content for commercial purposes without permission. You retain rights to data you enter (e.g., MyDiary notes).
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Cannabis Compliance</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      The Service provides tools and info for cannabis growing where it’s legal. It’s not medical advice, and we’re not liable for your cannabis-related activities. You’re responsible for complying with all applicable laws.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Limitation of Liability</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      The Service is provided “AS IS” without warranties. To the fullest extent allowed by law, Loyal9 LLC and its suppliers aren’t liable for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Damages from using or not being able to use the Service.</li>
      <li>Errors, inaccuracies, or interruptions in the Service.</li>
      <li>Third-party actions (e.g., affiliate purchases, App Store issues).</li>
      <li>Loss of data you enter (e.g., MyGrow inputs), which is stored on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Our total liability is limited to $0.00, as you don’t pay us directly. Some jurisdictions don’t allow these limits, so they’ll apply to the extent permitted.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Termination</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, without notice, if you violate these Terms or for any other reason. Upon termination, you must stop using the Service.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Governing Law</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      These Terms are governed by California law, excluding its conflict of law rules. Any disputes will be resolved in California courts, but you’re also subject to your local laws.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Dispute Resolution</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      If you have a concern, contact us at growapp@loyal9.app to resolve it informally. If we can’t resolve it, you agree to pursue claims in California courts.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Severability</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      If any part of these Terms is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect. We may waive a breach without waiving future breaches.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Changes to These Terms</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      We may update these Terms at any time. We’ll notify you via email or a notice on the Service for material changes. Continued use after changes means you agree to them.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Contact Us</h1>
