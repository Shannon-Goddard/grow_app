    <h1 data-custom-class="title">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="subtitle">Last updated: April 18, 2025</p>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Welcome to Loyal9 LLC! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our website (<a href="https://growappcannabis.guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">growappcannabis.guide</a>), our app (GrowApp - Cannabis Guide), or our games (like <em>Go Toke!</em> or <em>No Fish!</em>). We’re committed to keeping your data safe and being upfront about what we collect, especially since we’re all about helping you grow cannabis responsibly. This policy complies with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and other applicable laws.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Who We Are</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      “We,” “Us,” or “Our” refers to Loyal9 LLC, a California-based company located in Adelanto, CA. Our services include the GrowApp - Cannabis Guide website and app (available on App Store, Google Play, and Amazon AppStore) and cannabis-themed games on App Store and Google Play.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">What Data We Collect</h1>
    <h2 data-custom-class="heading_2">Data You Provide</h2>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Our website and app (collectively, the “Service”) don’t require accounts or collect personal data like your name or email. When you use features like MyGrow or MyDiary, any info you enter (e.g., strain, nutrients, notes) is stored locally on your device using localStorage or indexedDB. We don’t access or store this data on our servers.
    </p>
    <h2 data-custom-class="heading_2">Data Collected Automatically</h2>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      We use Google Analytics to collect non-personalized data to understand how our Service is used. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>General location (e.g., country, city)</li>
      <li>Device type (e.g., phone, computer)</li>
      <li>Pages visited and time spent</li>
      <li>Browser type and operating system</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      This data is aggregated and doesn’t identify you individually. We don’t collect IP addresses or unique device IDs beyond what Google Analytics requires.
    </p>
    <h2 data-custom-class="heading_2">Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      We use Google Analytics cookies (session and persistent) to track usage. These cookies are small files stored on your device to help us analyze site performance. In the future, growappcannabis.guide may use advertising cookies if we add ads (the app and games won’t have ads). You can disable cookies in your browser, but this may affect some features. See our <a href="https://www.loyal9.app/tools/contact-us/assets/policies/cookie-policy.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a> for details.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">How We Use Your Data</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      We use the data we collect to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve our Service (e.g., fix bugs, optimize features).</li>
      <li>Analyze usage trends (e.g., which pages are popular).</li>
      <li>Plan for future ads on growappcannabis.guide (not the app or games).</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Data Sharing</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      We don’t share or sell your personal data with anyone. Google Analytics processes usage data on our behalf, but it’s not linked to you as an individual. Affiliate partners (e.g., Amazon, Seed Supreme) handle their own transactions and don’t receive data from us. If we add ads to growappcannabis.guide, ad providers may use cookies, but we’ll update this policy first.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Data Retention</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Since we don’t collect personal data, we don’t retain it. Usage data from Google Analytics is kept for up to 14 months (the shortest period Google allows) for analysis, then deleted. Data you enter in MyGrow or MyDiary stays on your device until you clear it.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Your Rights (CCPA)</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Under the CCPA, California residents have the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Know what personal data we collect (described above).</li>
      <li>Request deletion of your data (though we don’t collect personal data).</li>
      <li>Opt-out of data sales (we don’t sell data).</li>
      <li>Non-discrimination for exercising these rights.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      To exercise these rights, contact us at growapp@loyal9.app. We’ll respond within 45 days. Since we only collect non-personalized Analytics data, there’s little to delete, but we’ll assist as needed.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Data Security</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      We use industry-standard measures to protect our Service, but no online platform is 100% secure. Since your MyGrow and MyDiary data stays on your device, you’re responsible for securing it.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Age Restriction</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Our Service and games are for users 21 and older due to their cannabis focus. We don’t knowingly collect data from anyone under 21. If we learn someone under 21 has used our Service, we’ll take steps to remove any related data (e.g., Analytics logs).
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Third-Party Links</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Our Service includes affiliate links (e.g., Amazon, Seed Supreme) and social media links. These third parties have their own privacy policies, and we’re not responsible for their practices. Review their policies before sharing personal info.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Cannabis Compliance</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      Our Service provides tools and info for cannabis growing where it’s legal. You’re responsible for complying with local, state, and federal laws (cannabis is illegal under U.S. federal law). We don’t collect data about your cannabis use beyond what you store locally.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Changes to This Policy</h1>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
      We may update this policy if our practices change (e.g., adding ads). We’ll notify you via email or a notice on our Service and update the “Last updated” date. Check back periodically for changes.
    </p>
    <h1 data-custom-class="heading_1">Contact Us</h1>
