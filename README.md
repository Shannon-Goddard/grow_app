# Project Overview
[<img alt="promo1" width="100%" src="pics\promo1.gif" />](https://www.loyal9.app/promo/promo1.html)
## Recent surveys suggest significant proportion of consumers started growing their own cannabis for personal consumption or gifting.
>"Homegrowers cultivate cannabis for a variety of reasons. Some opt-in due to a lack of other sources (14%), or to grow strains which they otherwise could not find to purchase (35%). Quality is another key consideration. Nearly one-third (32%) grow to avoid worries about contaminates such as pesticides, while 44% feel that they grow better-quality flower than they could find elsewhere. For others, it is a matter of convenience (52%), or less expense (46%). Nevertheless, a larger majority of homegrowers (70%) report growing cannabis because they enjoy it as a hobby.<div style="text-align: right" ><a href="https://newfrontierdata.com/cannabis-insights/for-many-cannabis-consumers-home-is-where-the-grow-is/">newfrontierdata.com</a></div>  

[Global Cannabis Cultivation Research Consortium](https://worldwideweed.nl/about/) formed in 2009 to monitor the growth of domestic cultivation and how cannabis markets were evolving. They started studies on home cannabis growing dating back to 2012. However, with only 5,000 respondents in their case study, the data can only be considered preliminary findings. An indirect approach of seeing the increase in personal cultivation would be to look at the year over year growth in revenue of companies that sell cannabis cultivation products.

# Limitations  
<sub>This website is currently using localStorage. The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.</sub> 

<sub>localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while localStorage data has no expiration time, sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends — that is, when the page is closed. (localStorage data for a document loaded in a "private browsing" or "incognito" session is cleared when the last "private" tab is closed and/or browser history is cleared)</sub>

**MEANING: YOUR GROW WILL BE ERASED AFTER YOU CLEAR YOUR BROWSER HISTORY!** Eventually, localStorage will become "server side". . . /əˈven(t)SH(o͞o)əlē/.
