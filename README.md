# Project Overview
[![flowhub article clip](pics/news.gif)](https://flowhub.com/cannabis-industry-statistics)
## Recent surveys suggest significant proportion of consumers started growing their own cannabis for personal consumption or gifting.  
<br>
<br>  

>"Homegrowers cultivate cannabis for a variety of reasons. Some opt-in due to a lack of other sources (14%), or to grow strains which they otherwise could not find to purchase (35%). Quality is another key consideration. Nearly one-third (32%) grow to avoid worries about contaminates such as pesticides, while 44% feel that they grow better-quality flower than they could find elsewhere. For others, it is a matter of convenience (52%), or less expense (46%). Nevertheless, a larger majority of homegrowers (70%) report growing cannabis because they enjoy it as a hobby.

[Global Cannabis Cultivation Research Consortium](https://worldwideweed.nl/about/) formed in 2009 to monitor the growth of domestic cultivation and how cannabis markets were evolving. They started studies on home cannabis growing dating back to 2012. However, with only 5,000 respondents in their case study, the data can only be considered preliminary findings. An indirect approach of seeing the increase in personal cultivation would be to look at the year over year growth in revenue of companies that sell cannabis cultivation products.
