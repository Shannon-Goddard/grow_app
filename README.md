## Project Overview  
In this module, we used a .csv file with 2,793 rows of data for each strain listed on the wikileaf website and added key data points needed for each strain to allow concise information for the user and filtering for future projects, bringing the data line to 36,312. Using Python, JQuery, Java Script, CSS, and HTML to create a filter search with the transformed data.

## Resources  
- **Software:** VS Code   
- **Languages:** Java Script, JQuery, CSS, and HTML  
- **Data Source:** [ALL_data.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shannon-Goddard/grow_data/main/Resources/csv/ALL_data.csv)    

## Objectives  
- Create a filter search from a “real-world” classification dataset and display more information from the user's selection
