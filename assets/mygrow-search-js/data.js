    info: "Sometimes shock value can be a big asset when naming and marketing strains. Originally called “Cush”, this strain was re-dubbed “Green Crack” by none other than cannabis connoisseur Snoop Dogg after he sampled its intense sativa effects. Although some still prefer the name Cush to sidestep any unwanted cannabis stigma, the love for this fruity and earthy strain is unanimous. Green Crack’s origins are disputed -- originally bred in Athens, GA in the 1970s, it is descended from the ever-popular Skunk #1, but it may also have some Afghani landrace indica in its background.

Providing the best of what sativa varieties have to offer, it’s a great strain for enhancing your appreciation of your surroundings or simply as a way to help you get up and go. It’s also unique in its potency -- even for more experienced cannabis fans, a little bit of this controlled substance can go a long way.",

It is indigenous to the Hindu Kush mountain chain that forms the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The meaning of the word “Kush” is disputed, and has been traced back to a Persian term for “Hindu killer” (in reference to the danger of crossing the inhospitable mountains) as well as to Avestan words meaning simply “water mountain.” In any case, Kush has become a byword for weed and is often used a suffix in the names of different strains, regardless of whether those strains have Hindu Kush in their lineage.",
    more_info: "Seeds of Hindu Kush -- along with seeds of other Asian landrace varieties like Afghani -- were brought to the U.S. in the 1960s and 70s by cannabis enthusiasts and explorers who traveled along a route that has come to be known as the “hippie trail.” In time, Hindu Kush has, perhaps inevitably, been crossed with other strains to allow for stability and adaptation to a radically different climate than its mountainous point of origin; as such, “true” Hindu Kush may not be widely available in the Western Hemisphere. Nevertheless, Hindu Kush is a relatively pure strain, simpler and often more potent that the novelty crossbreeds that continue to multiply in today’s competitive cannabis market. It is prized for its heavily sedative, almost narcotic properties and its highly resinous flowers. The THC composition of Hindu Kush is typically measured at between 15% and 20%.",

Blueberry is popular nationwide. It won top marks in the 2000 High Times Cannabis Cup for Best Grow and best strain overall. Blueberry has a THC content that ranges between 15% and 24%.",
    more_info: "Flowers of this strain are small and densely-packed, as one might expect of an Grow-dominant variety. The compact forest green leaves are often flecked with traces of purple and red. These latter colors develop due to high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins in this strain’s genetics -- as the plants are exposed to colder than average temperatures during the growing period, these pigments are activated, bringing out colorful hues. The leaves are coated in almost transparent trichomes, which may be harder to see than that milky or amber-colored glands covering similarly resinous strains. Nevertheless, buds of Blueberry are very sticky and may be difficult to break up by hand without the use of a grinder.",

Whatever its beginnings, Chemdawg has become a staple in the U.S. cannabis market for its unique taste and upbeat, energetic high. It has also been used to crossbreed several popular and successful strains. Chemdawg’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and 20%.",

Due to the combination of their loose structure and resinous texture, buds of Chemdawg are particularly difficult to break up by hand -- users preparing flowers for joints or pipes will have an easier time with a grinder. The sticky flowers are threaded through with red to orange pistils. Chemdawg has a smell reminiscent of diesel fuel (which many say is the source of the “chem” in its name). The pungent flowers also give off odors of earthy musk and some pine. As long as flowers are properly cured, this strain has smooth smoke that tastes sour and when inhaled.

The leaves clump together in slightly long, conical shapes that are threaded through with red to fiery orange pistils.

These latter colors emerge when high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by cold temperatures in the growing process. Cloudy trichomes cover the already-colorful leaves, giving them a silvery sheen. The high resin content also makes Blue Cookies a hard strain to break up for pipes or joints without the use of a grinder. Blue Cookies has bold flavors to match its visual appeal. Users will notice a simultaneously fruity and dank smell from the cured buds that feels like a combination of Blueberry’s berry and GSC’s earthy profiles. Breaking or burning the flowers brings out a rich smell that is more reminiscent of leather. The smoke hits very smoothly and carries a slight taste of cherry with some skunk on the exhale. Interestingly, despite its purple coloration, Blue Cookies does not have a detectable grape flavor -- this is because the same anthocyanin pigments that dictate the strain’s color do not have a corresponding effect on its taste.",

    strain: "Golden Goat",
    info: "A sativa-dominant hybrid with a distinctive color and odor, Golden Goat was created largely by chance. Unidentified breeders in Topeka, Kansas -- an area not usually thought of as a cannabis hot spot -- found that a male plant of hybrid Hawaiian/Romulan had fertilized a female plant of sativa Island Sweet Skunk. The result was a strain with colorful flowers and high trichome production that’s come to be known as Golden Goat. This happy accident is valued for its strong and well-balanced high and its soothing analgesic properties. Golden Goat has 1% of pain-relieving CBD in its genes, as well as THC composition that averages about 16% but can test as high as 23%.",
    more_info: "Golden Goat has dense and medium-sized buds that have a solidly Grow appearance, with heavy and tightly-packed leaves. Its leaves are a bright green with some hints of pink or red in certain phenotypes -- these varied hues are the result of pigments called anthocyanins being activated by unusually cold weather during the plants’ vegetative state. The flowers are also very resinous and coated in amber-colored trichomes that give the cured buds the golden glow that’s referenced in this strain’s name. When grown and cured properly, buds are very sticky and when handled will leave behind a good amount of residue. Adding to Golden Goat’s bag appeal is a strong and complex scent. The initial impression is fruity and tropical, as is typical of Hawaiian landrace-descended strains like Mango. This citrus profile exists alongside a more sour tinge, likely the result of the Island Sweet Skunk parent strain. To round this all out, buds can smell spicy and earthy when burned. All of these notes come together in a strong and acrid smoke that can sting the eyes and tickle the throat, causing users to cough. Although some find it pleasant, others have described Golden Goat’s scent and taste as a clash of incompatible flavors, leading to some conjecture that the “goat” in its name is actually meant to describe this strain’s taste. This is an especially pungent variety, so smokers looking to maintain discretion should plan accordingly.",

It is the brainchild of Barney’s Farm, the Amsterdam-based growers who have given us such powerful strains as LSD and Liberty Haze. Critical Kush is a cross between Afghani-descended Critical Mass and none other than OG Kush. Cannabis testing lab gives this bud consistently high marks, with THC measurements between 16% and a whopping 29%. With that kind of potency, Critical Kush is almost certain to put you in critical condition. Critical Kush sets itself apart with medium to large-sized nugs of resin-filled goodness. The buds are densely-packed, as you might expect of a pure indica. Leaves are a bright shade of spring green and are twisted through with deep orange pistils. A network of shiny trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces of these large buds, making them very difficult to break up without the help of a grinder.",
    more_info: "When properly cured, flowers of Critical Kush emit a dank, earthy odor. There are some hints of citrus to brighten things up -- an aroma that becomes even more evident when grinding this bud -- but overall, the impression is dank and kushy. When combusted, Critical Kush may burn with a harsh and acrid smoke that can sting the eyes and sinuses. On the exhale, this thick smoke tastes like pine with a slight spicy kick. Finally, Critical Kush can be a very pungent smoke, and those looking to keep their consumption discreet should take any necessary precautions. Since Critical Kush offers a true creeper of a high, smokers should wait a while after their first toke before boosting dosage. As much as 15 minutes after sampling this strain, users begin to feel a tingle of relaxation spread through the limbs and core. Smokers also report a decreased heart rate and a lessening of muscular tension. Although mental effects are subtle, Critical Kush does have some effect on the senses, with many reporting visual or auditory distortion. Other than that, smokers shouldn’t expect an intense cerebral experience; on the contrary, this bud is more likely to leave users contentedly dopey. It’s a good choice for an evening indoors, spent working on mindless tasks like cleaning. If you’re riding a more sleepy vibe, it’s also a great option for binge-watching or for zoning out to some soothing music. Although Critical Kush can be fun in social situations, note that it can trigger couchlock in higher doses, and may make you less willing to actively engage with company. It should go without saying that, because of its heavily sedative effects, Critical Kush is better suited to evening than to daytime use.",

Unlike some of the newer strains out there without a lot of mileage yet, Santa Marta Colombian Gold is about as classic as cannabis gets, dating back to popular usage in the United States in the 1960s after being grown in Colombia (in the Santa Marta mountains that became its namesake). Keep reading to learn about how this strain can still bring it after six decades of highs.",
    more_info: "Also called “Colombian Gold,” this strain is a genetic relative of Acapulco Gold, which is famous in its own right. Santa Marta is a Sativa-dominant strain (75/25) from the breeder known as Reeferman, bred from two Colombia cuts, one pure Sativa and one Sativa/Indica hybrid. Being adapted from landrace strains, Santa Marta Colombian Gold has the heartiness inherent to its natural evolution, growing in warm climates out in the barren mountains. It’s a slow grower, taking as long as 11 weeks to flower. However, its long lineage rewards patient growers with a clump of orange-green buds on a smallish plant (and the promise of an incredible evening). The plants grow with plentiful leaves that come in loosely arranged, farther apart from each other than you may be used to. The buds grow in long shapes around the pale green leaves with a lot of resiny white, almost yellow trichomes. Even in the ground, they give off the scent of earthy skunk, pine, and a hint of lime.",

Purple Kush is rumored to have been used in the cross, but not much information exists on the strain, giving Trinity a mysterious aura and cult status.

Monster Cookies has a mostly berry and grape-tinged flavor profile, much like parent strain Granddaddy Purple.

In addition to its striking visuals, Key Lime Pie also boasts a complex flavor profile. Most immediately, the buds have a fruity, slightly sour odor which may remind many of citrus or lime. Underneath these top notes are vaguely herbal scents -- some may detect the same minty freshness associated with Key Lime Pie’s cousin strain Thin Mints. Burning the buds shows off the OG genetics and gives off hints of spice and musk. Notably, this strain is not known for having a grape-like taste; the same anthocyanin pigments that produce its purple leaves are not responsible for any nuances in flavor. Key Lime Pie burns smooth, and on the exhale, leaves the impression of a sweet and sour candy mixed with some spice.",

The long-lasting experience of enjoying White Runtz is enjoyed by most who can find it, though it remains a bit of an exclusive offering by the Runtz growers out of California. It’s so good that Runtz has pretty much locked down the sale of seeds. But if you can find the buds, you’re in for a treat.",

We know that it harvests in late October and can be grown inside or out but prefers cooler climates. The plant grows large, thick nugs shaped like spades.

Most places specifically list it as a cross between a female OG Kush and Sour Diesel hybrid that was crossed with a male Sour Diesel. However, those claiming it came from The Breeders Lab, list it as a cross between NYC Diesel, OG Kush and Master Kush. Often stated as needing anywhere between nine and eleven weeks to flower, this strain can have a THC count of up to 24%.",

Notably, Blue Magic seems not to have inherited grandparent strain Blueberry’s high concentration of anthocyanin pigments -- as a result, it’s rare to find flowers of Blue Magic that exhibit streaks of deep blue or purple.

    info: "Where’s My Bike (WMB), is a popular hybrid strain of cannabis that is incredibly Sativa-dominant. Created in Amsterdam by Karma Genetics, this strain is a cross of the ever-popular strain Amnesia and Biker Kush. Test data for this strain shows an average THC level of 26%, with the high end and low end going unreported. Likewise, there is no information regarding the CBD levels found within WMB. Although this strain originates in Europe, there has been no shortage of the plant stateside, as many cannabis users report run-ins with the strain at their local dispensary.",
    more_info: "Like most Sativa-dominant strains of cannabis, Where’s My Bike nugs are often large, fluffy, and overgrown. The nugs are typically a drab forest green in color, with fuzzy orange hairs sparsely accenting the surface of the bud. Milky-white trichomes envelop the bud like a thick fleece blanket that’s sure to get even the most experienced smoker stoned. Out of the packaging, this bud smells of earth, herbs, and spice with berry spread evenly throughout. Excitingly, the flavor expands upon the aroma of the bud as an intense and diverse flavor profile is developed through the burning of the bud. Most note that Where’s My Bike tastes like if someone started chewing an entire pack of bubble gum and then threw in a bunch of kitchen spices for flavor. Although this description may seem a bit wonky, smokers around the world have noted that the flavor is unique and quite surprisingly tasty.",

The leaves are a vibrant green, and contrast with rust-colored hairs which are actually the flower’s pistils, intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants.

Most of the time, this bud is a brilliant forest green with thick, long orange hairs that cover almost the entire surface of the bud. Other times, the flower is a brilliant violet with little hints of minty green that shine through from the middle of the flower. This flower is always covered in a blanket of translucent trichomes, and on occasion a thick resinous layer. Out of the package, this bud will smell like a cross between a new pine air freshener and that classic Kush stink.

Buds are long and tend to be a lighter shade of green, with an aroma that’s enticing and potent.

Peyote Cookies is the brainchild of infamous international cannabis growers Barney’s Farm. This Netherlands-based cannabis company is the producer of a number of incredibly popular strains while also shipping seeds almost worldwide for personal growers. In order to create this powerful hybrid strain, these breeders crossed a classic strain, Peyote Purple, with one of their proprietary strains, Cookies Kush. Resulting in Peyote Cookies, a powerful Grow hybrid that is best suited for afternoon and evening consumption. The THC concentration in this potent plant averages around 20%.",
    more_info: "The physical aspects of this flower cannot be understated, it is truly a magnificent flower. The Peyote Cookies plant produces flowers that are incredibly dense and resinous, so much so that growers often use mesh and supports to hold up the stalks which struggle to support these oversized flowers. The flowers themselves take on hues which range from bright mint green all the way to redish-purple, depending on the grow and cure. The strain is highly resistant to molds which makes it a great strain for beginners to test their luck on. Indoors it yields up to 600 grams per square meter of plant, while yielding between 500-550 grams per plant outdoors. The flowers have a sweet but earthy aroma that is accented by tropical fruits and nutty vanilla.

They are most known for creating the Gelato strain and popularizing its many phenotypes. This has created a phenomenon in the cannabis community where influencers and celebrities alike are coveted for consuming Sherbinkski bud and wearing their clothing products. Guava Gelato is a phenotype of the famous Gelato strain, which means it is one of the many individual genetic ways Gelato presents itself. It shares the same parents as other Gelato phenotypes: Thin Mint GSC and Sunset Sherbert. This particular phenotype is known for a distinct and unique smell/flavor combo that sets it apart from the rest.",
    more_info: "Guava Gelato buds are not any different from plain Gelato buds physically. They often take the shape of medium-sized nugs with hues ranging from mint green to dark purple. These dense buds are jam-packed with crystal trichomes so plentiful they’re likely to fall of the bud as you handle it. Likewise, the nugs are wrapped with bright orange hairs that give the flower a bit of depth and contrast. Finding big buds is going to be very hard, as they sell out almost instantly. You’re more likely to find this strain in the shake section or in the form of concentrate. The smell of these flowers is the primary reason Guava Gelato has earned itself a distinction from the rest of the pack. The terpene profile in this bud is exclusively unique to this phenotype of Gelato, as it contains aromas of creamy tropical fruits mixed with piña colada and what most can only describe as a sharp hoppy scent. The flavor is quite similar and tastes like, as one reviewer put it, “a piña colada with hops.”",

This strain’s THC has been measured at between 15% and 22%.",
    more_info: "Lucky Charms sets itself apart with large flowers that adhere in elongated, almost cylindrical clusters. The buds have a dense, Grow-typical structure, with leaves tightly coiled around their central stems. The leaves themselves are a mossy green and are threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. Much like parent strain The White, Lucky Charms is also absolutely coated in snowy trichomes that make the flowers difficult to break up without use of a quality grinder.",

As might be expected due to their Grow background, Pink Lemonade’s buds also have an Grow-typical structure, dense and nugget-like, with leaves attached tightly to their central stems. These leaves themselves are especially notable for their patchwork of olive green and deep purple hues. These latter colors are the result of pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genetics; these become activated and trigger blue and purple shades when stimulated by cold weather during the growing process.

Well-balanced between mental and physical effects, this Sour Grape is a great way to enhance a variety of activities, both social and intimate. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured this strain’s potency at between 14% and a staggering 24%.",
    more_info: "Sour Grape has small to medium-sized flowers that appear spherical in shape when fully cured.  The tiny buds adhere in a dense and heavy Grow structure, with the leaves tightly coiled around central stems. The leaves themselves are a dull, earthy shade of dark green; although many phenotypes boast vibrant streaks of purple. These purple hues are the result of a process akin to changes in autumn foliage, and are the result of high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins being excited by colder than average temperatures in the growing process. Trichomes dot the outer and inner surfaces of the leaves and appear more dewy and transparent than white and opaque. Regardless of its color, however, the resin makes these flowers incredibly sticky and difficult to break up without the use of a grinder. Flowers of Sour Grape have a unique aroma that appeals to fans of both dank and more fruity strains. The predominant smell is a chemical, fuel-like funk, clearly passed on from Sour Diesel. Almost as strong in intensity, the  tangy, slightly tropical scent of fruit blooms just underneath. When combusted, Sour Grape has a surprisingly smooth smoke and tastes simultaneously grape-like and skunky on the exhale. It is important to note that this strain’s signature grape flavor is coincidental to its purple coloring -- the pigments that produce Sour Grape’s shades of violet jjave no corresponding effect on the strain’s taste.",

The strain is similar in that regard, because you’ll want to pick up some of this bud based off of its bag appeal and wonderful effects. Ecto Cooler was first created by a mysterious, US-based cannabis company known as Seeds of Compassion. In order to create Ecto Cooler, these breeders crossed California Orange with Gorilla Biscuit.

    more_info: "Mob Boss is marked by small to medium buds that have a somewhat tapered, conical shape. The buds are very dense when properly cured, with the light green leaves tightly coiling in on themselves. Red hairs -- which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants -- are threaded through the leaves. These already-colorful flowers are covered in trichomes, lending them a silvery and moist-looking sheen. As a result, buds of Mob Boss can be very sticky and difficult to break up without the use of a grinder. The smell of sweet citrus jumps off of these flowers, with herbal notes lurking just underneath. Breaking open or combusting the flowers gives off a more musky odor. The smoke from this strain is harsh and cough-inducing and can sting users’ eyes and sinuses. On the exhale, the overall impression is a mix of sweet and sour flavors that tends to linger on the palate.",

Growers recommend taking advantage of its many side branches using multi-branching growing methods.

With surprisingly energetic and mentally-focused effects, Somango is sure to please indica and sativa lovers alike. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between 12% and 23%; some phenotypes are also bred for moderate levels of CBD.",

The buds also have a sativa-like structure, appearing loose and fluffy with leaves easily torn away from their central stems. Leaves themselves are an olive green and are shot through with vibrant orange pistils. Frequently, phenotypes of Somango also contain streaks of deep blue and purple in their flowers. These colors come about when pigments called anthocyanins are agitated by cold weather as the plants grow; the process is similar in principle to the changing of foliage in autumn. A blanket of translucent white trichomes covers these already-colorful flowers, giving them a dewy sheen and making them very sticky to the touch.",

This strain offers a multi-faceted high, with an initial cerebral kick that soon mellows into full body relaxation. Flowers of Apple Kush have tested at between 15% and 20% THC content.",
    more_info: "Apple Kush is marked by medium-sized flowers that are long and almost cylindrical in shape. Cured properly, the buds have a dense, compact structure, with the leaves tightly compressed together. Leaves themselves are a bright green with hints of yellow. The hairy pistils, which appear when in the plant's early growth stages, stand out against the green buds in hues of orange and brown. A thick coating of trichomes, on the surfaces and inner crevices of the flowers, make this strain difficult to break up without the use of a grinder. While the flowers have a certain clean, fruity smell that reminds some users of apples, there are also prominent floral notes. Grinding or breaking up the buds offers a more sour tang, reminiscent of Cheese. When combusted, Apple Kush has an acrid odor and a harsh smoke that might induce coughing and cause eyes to water.

A sativa-typical structure means that the leaves grow off of central stems in tufts and have a fluffy texture and appearance. The leaves themselves are a vibrant spring green and are threaded through with red and orange hairs; these hairs are actually pistils, the female plant's reproductive structures that collect pollen from male plants. Notably, Alpha Blue does not seem to have inherited the pigmentation from grandparent strain Blueberry that results in blue and purple hues. This strain's scent, however, is undoubtedly familiar to fans of Alpha Blue and Blue Dream. The smell of sweet blueberries wafts off of the cured flowers. A slightly sour funk from NYC Diesel also imparts a more tart character to the berry smell. When ground or broken up, Alpha Blue's flowers show their Diesel influence even more, with a sweet, fuel-tinged odor.

A few different strains have been proposed for Blue Mango’s parentage -- some claim it’s descended from DJ Short’s cut of Blueberry and powerhouse indica William’s Wonder while others say it’s the product of Mango Kush and the ever-popular Blue Dream. Whatever its lineage, Blue Mango delivers lasting relaxation and is potent even for veteran cannabis users.",
    more_info: "Flowers of Blue Mango are medium to large in size and have the long, tapered buds more characteristic of sativa varieties. The fluffy, somewhat ragged leaves pull away relatively easily from their central stems. They appear pale green and are offset by rust-colored hairs (which are actually pistils, structures intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Some phenotypes of Blue Mano also express deep blue and purple hues in their leaves. These latter colors emerge when pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by cold weather in the growing process, similar to the process that causes foliage to change color in autumn. Trichomes cover these multicolored flowers, accounting for the strain’s psychoactivity and giving it a very resinous texture. A mouthwatering blueberry scent jumps off of the cured buds, leaving little doubt that Blueberry is somewhere in Blue Mango’s lineage. Hanging out underneath this aroma is an overly sweet, almost sour funk. When combusted, this strain has a harsh smoke that may trigger coughing and watery eyes. A tropical-tinged blueberry flavor comes through when smoke is exhaled. This unique taste is best savored in a joint or a freshly-cleaned pipe.",

The leaves are a vibrant spring green with yellowish pistils threaded throughout. Certain phenotypes also have shades of purple, a color that comes about when anthocyanin pigments in the plant are agitated by unusually cold temperatures during the growing process. Milky white trichomes cover the outer surfaces and inner crevices of the flowers and give the cured buds an extremely sticky, resinous texture that makes them difficult to break up by hand. Royal Kush has the full-bodied incense aroma of parent strain Afghani, with notes of pine and sandalwood. Underneath these scents is a sour, citrus-like tinge. When combusted, this strain gives off smoke that may seem remarkably smooth for an Grow. On the exhale, users will detect a skunky-sweet taste with a little bit of fruit. Notably, Royal Kush has no discernible grape or berry flavors; the pigments that determine this strain’s purple hues do not have a similar effect on its taste.

Cured properly, the flowers have an earthy, dank smell (imparted from White Widow, which is known more for its extreme stickiness than its taste profile) mixed with some sweet citrus fruit (passed on from AK-47, which has a sweet and floral aftertaste from the various Asian and South American landrace strains in its genetics). When combusted, flowers smell more skunky and slightly spicy. Some have described the smoke from White Russian as harsh and lung-expanding. Smoke tastes slightly spicy when exhaled.",

Blackwater’s THC, as measured by cannabis lab Analytics 360, can range from 10% to a potent 20%.",
    more_info: "Blackwater’s chunky buds have a classically Grow bud structure: leaves are densely-packed and tightly curled in on themselves when properly cured. High resin production makes the leaves adhere in large, solid flowers rather than popcorn-like nuggets. The flowers appear dark green, with some phenotypes showing flashes of purple inherited from the Mendocino Purple parent strain; this latter color comes about when high concentrations of specific pigments are activated by colder than average weather in the cultivation process. Blackwater’s large, colorful buds are covered in a substantial layer of trichomes, often making them difficult to break apart by hand. This strain’s “bag appeal” persists even after the bag is cracked open -- users will notice a deeply sweet smell of berry and grape to complement its purple hues. Taking time to break open the flowers will also show evidence of the Afghani landrace lineage, with an unmistakably herbal, hashy smell.

Many phenotypes of Berry Bomb also show off muted shades of blue and purple in their leaves; these surprising hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins are agitated by colder than average temperatures during the growing process.

The leaves are a mossy green, threaded through with plenty of hairy orange pistils. Certain phenotypes also show off shades of purple, ranging from lavender to a deep indigo. These hues are the result of a process in which pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. Cheesequake’s flowers are also covered in cloudy white trichomes, making them very resinous to the touch.

Hanging out underneath are some clashing floral, berry, and grape notes passed on from Querkle. Notably, any grape aroma or taste is totally coincidental to Cheesequake’s purple leaves -- the pigments responsible for the strain’s color do not correspond to its flavor profile. Although the strain’s smoke is smooth to inhale, all these flavors can make for an acrid, eye-stinging smell when the buds are burnt.

While growing the male Afghani plants pollinated a Skunk #1 female, creating a ton of F1 hybrid seeds. The following year Gerrit moved to an indoor setup and grew some clone that he got from a friend, as well as the Skunk #1 and the accidental hybrid seeds. As the plants grew he took notice of the fact that the hybrids were doing better than the pure Skunk plants but they lacked the flavor and aroma of the Skunk. Having run out of the pure Skunk seeds, Gerrit decided to cross the last of his female Skunks with pollen from some of the male hybrids. The children from this coupling grew as strongly as the F1 hybrids and had an even better smell and taste than the original Skunk plants. Warlock is the final result that would go on to be the mainstay of Magus Genetics, which would be used in nearly all their later strains.",

Unlike so many strains that have been bred to match modern tastes from venerated favorites within the last decade, Skunk #1 is an oldie, one of the strains that baby boomers talk about when they tell stories about the 60s. Even today, Skunk #1 is highly relaxing and interesting to take in. Continue reading to learn why oldies are still goodies when it comes to this skunky favorite by Sacred Seed Co.",
    more_info: "The strain was bred by crossing Afghan Grow strains, still unknown to this day, with famous Sativas, Colombian Gold and Acapulco Gold. Its breeders made the strain in Holland, but its genetic lineage stretches around the world, from South America to Thailand. The result is a potent, Grow-leaning hybrid (65/35) that earns its keep with a pungent flavor profile and potent effects. Indoors, the strain takes 8-9 weeks to flower while outdoors, it harvests in mid-October after reaching a medium-sized height. Skunk #1 can handle either condition with confidence so long as you have a warm climate to nurture it in, complete with ample sunlight (or the artificial equivalent).",

As resinous as it is colorful, this bud can be a potent smoke, even for cannabis veterans. Its THC content has been measured at between 15% and 19%.",

The squat and compact flowers have an Grow-type structure, as their relatively small leaves overlap and coil tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a dark shade of forest green and often also show patches of purple. These purple hues are due to the presence of pigments called anthocyanins, passed on from parent strain Mendocino Purps. Finally, these already-colorful nuggets are encrusted with cloudy white trichomes that make them very sticky and account for their high psychoactivity.",

This strain confers heavy sedative effects that make it appealing to recreational and medical users alike. Blue Ivy’s THC content has been reported at between 15% and 20%.",

The leaves themselves are a vibrant spring green, offset by brown to rust-colored hairs (which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Plentiful trichomes give the flowers a silvery-white sheen and an incredibly sticky texture. The smell of blueberries, passed on from Blueberry via parent strain Blue Dream, predominates. A skunky, chemical-inflected odor -- likely the influence of OG Kush -- gives the blueberry aroma a more tart and funky quality. When combusted, Blue Ivy’s flowers give off a harsh smoke that may sting the sinuses and cause users to cough.

The buds adhere in a dense Grow structure and the tightly coiled leaves appear bright green with orange pistils. Certain phenotypes are streaked with varying shades of blue and purple. These latter colors come about when pigments called anthocyanins are agitated by cold temperatures in the growing process; this colorful transformation is similar to the mechanism by which depleted chlorophyll levels cause foliage to change colors in autumn. Trichomes cover the buds, giving them a sticky texture and a moist sheen. The bright and fruity smell of blueberries -- so often associated with other strains descended from Blueberry bud -- is made more complex in this case by the presence of Skunk-derived Cheese in the plant’s genetics. Blueberry Cheesecake smells simultaneously fruity and sour, with a hint of citrus tang. Grinding or breaking up the buds intensifies the underlying funkiness. When burnt, this strain has a thick, lung-expanding smoke that tastes simultaneously like fruit and cheese on the exhale.

The big buds are coated in syrupy trichomes, making this an especially difficult strain to break up by hand, fluffy leaves notwithstanding. After they’re cured, buds of C4 have a mellow scent that is similar to moss and cedar. Sharp notes of lemon zest accentuate the predominantly woodsy odor.

    more_info: "Frankenstein is marked by medium-sized flowers that hold a spade-like shape, tapering down from a broad base into a pointed tip. Buds cling together in a dense, solid structure, as is characteristic of Grows. The leaves are a mossy shade of green and are twisted through with curly, rust-colored hairs -- which are actually pistils, meant to catch pollen from would-be fertilizing male plants. A high volume of trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces of these buds, accounting for their psychoactivity and making them very difficult to break up without the use of a grinder.",

These spindly flowers have a surprisingly sativa-like bud structure, with their fluffy leaves clinging loosely to their central stems. The leaves themselves are this strain’s tour de force -- more often than not, they are a veritable camouflage pattern of green and dark purple. The latter hues are due to pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genetics which can trigger vivid colors when stimulated by cold weather during the growing process.

This strain delivers potent effects that lean toward the sedated, Grow end of the spectrum. Its THC content has been measured at between 10% and 19%; Power Kush has also been found to have higher-than-average concentrations of the therapeutic cannabinoid CBD.",
    more_info: "Power Kush is marked by small to medium-sized flowers that adhere to a spade-like formation, tapering down from a broad base into a pointed tip. Some phenotypes show more elongated, tubular flowers than others. These buds seem to have a hybridized structure -- compact, but with their leaves spiraling loosely outward from their central stems, rather than curled tightly inward. The leaves themselves are a mossy green and are trailed throughout with orange and brown pistils. Cloudy white trichomes give the flowers a dewy sheen, as well as a very sticky texture, making them hard to break apart without a quality grinder.",

Sensi Seeds believed they achieved this ideal by mixing the genetics of an Afghanistan Grow, Skunk #1, a Jamaican Sativa, and a Hawaiian Sativa. American Dream is Grow dominant but provides a subtle cerebral effect with a calming body high. Because it is not overpowering, American Dream is useful for daytime pain relief.",

The leaves, which curl tightly inward toward their central stems, are a mossy green and are threaded through with twisting orange pistils. Many phenotypes of the strain are also flecked with pale shades of purple; these eye-catching hues are the result of anthocyanin pigments in the strain’s genetics (possibly passed on from multicolored parent strain Harlequin) being stimulated by cold weather during the growing process.

The aroma is sweet and fruity with a lemonberry accent and it may smell a bit like skunk and fuel. One person commented that it smells like turpentine and grape juice. Others have said that the smell is multi-dimensional and cannot be described. The purple appearance though, makes this strain stand out as one of the more flamboyant cannabis strains.",

The strain is a cross between two potent varieties in their own right: Jack Herer-descended Jack The Ripper and Mad Scientist, an Grow that gave us Dr. Who. Professor Chaos provides smokers with the energy and creative thinking needed to accomplish anything from errands to more complicated work. Its THC content ranges from 20% to 25%.",

The tapered, medium-sized buds have a fluffy, sativa-like texture and the leaves tear away easily from the central stem. Leaves themselves are a light green, offset by pistils that range in color from yellow to deep orange. The chunky buds are dusted by icy trichomes, making this strain slightly sticky to the touch. When properly cured, the flowers smell strongly of tangy, sour citrus. Grinding or breaking open the buds gives off a more piney odor. Although Professor Chaos’ taste isn’t especially memorable, users may detect a spiciness when exhaling. This is a very pungent strain -- its funk can linger for a while after users have finished smoking.",

Nugs are very dense and absolutely covered with a ton of trichomes, and her flavors and aromas aren’t anything to shake a stick at either. Primarily sweet with a bit of tartness, you’ll pick out notes of lemon and tropical fruit, especially pineapple.",

    info: "Gorilla Grips is an Grow-dominant hybrid strain of cannabis first grown by SinCity Seeds. This small seed collective originally began when a group of underground growers in Los Vegas collectivised and began preserving the genetics of their personal plants. After the legalization of cannabis in Las Vegas, these growers went legit and began selling their product legally. Gorilla Grips is the product of crossing Gorilla Glue #4 with SinCity’s own Blue Power. This cross resulted in a strain with hard-hitting and long-lasting effects which often tests between 23-25% THC. This daytime strain is often labeled as “Gorilla Grip” or just “Grip” in some markets, but all three names refer to the same strain.",
    more_info: "The buds produced by a Gorilla Grips plant are often oversized golf-ball sized nugs that range from olive green all the way to deep purple depending on the grow and harvest. They are often covered in bright orange hairs and a dusting of off-white and amber trichomes. This bud is a stinker, and is absolutely going to offend your upstairs neighbors if you smoke indoors. Even busting open the packaging of this bud is enough to fill the room with a pungent aroma of skunky earth mixed with sour grapes and spicy herbs that feels heavy in your lungs. The flavor is a lot lighter, with a bit of a blueberry-grape flavor accented by pungent skunk on the exhale.",

    info: "Hades OG, also known as Hades OG #25, is an interesting evenly-balanced hybrid strain of cannabis first grown in the United States of America. It is important to know that Hades OG is the result of both extreme testing and sheer luck. Humboldt Seed Company, a popular California cannabis grower conducted a phenotype hunt in 2016 which involved growing thousands of OG plants looking for any interesting phenotypes. They collaborated with Dark Heart Nursery, who picked this particular plant out of the narrowed-down field of one-hundred plants in front of them. This particular OG plant, number 25, was the result of Dark Heart Nursery’s Fire OG being crossed with Humboldt Seed Company’s Humboldt OG. As the name Hades OG suggests, this phenotype was chosen for its “mean” looking appearance, including serrated leaves and dark hue in addition to its strong production capabilities. This evening strain provides a balance of both heady and body effects much to the delight of almost everyone who consumes it.",
    more_info: "Hades OG nugs are typical of OG flowers, meaning they’re medium sized and rounded off during the flowering period. They often present themselves as a hue somewhere between forest green and violet purple. They are covered in white trichomes and a few burnt orange hairs. The bud smells quite similar to lemon-scented Pine-sol mixed with the classic diesel and kush scents of the OG family. The plants themselves are coveted because they grow quite large, and are known to double in size during the flowering period. Experienced growers who trim the excess leaves on their plants can see incredibly large yields, which is one of the reasons the original Hades OG plant was chosen for cultivation. This doesn’t mean it’s hard to grow, in fact, Dark Heart Nursery suggests this plant for beginners to intermediates looking for a heavy yielding plant.",

There are two very distinct phenotypes of the Caramel Candy Kush. The first, which accounts for about 70% of all the Caramel Candy Kush on the market today, is quite dense and boxy. These nugs are often very heavy and spongey to the touch, with an aroma of cherry, caramel, and vanilla. This phenotype tends to be more like Bubba in its structure and Miss Universe in its aroma. The second phenotype, which accounts for the rest of the flower in circulation, is largely Kush-dominant in nature with some physical attributes inherited from Miss Universe. This bud tends to be a little drier to the touch, with an aroma of caramel, grapes, cherries, coffee, and cream.",

This strain has a wide variety of uses but is most popular amongst those who would prefer their medicine be less-psychoactive and patients with illnesses that CBD treats quite well. Critical Cure was first bred by the infamous Barney’s Farms, a cannabis company out of the Netherlands which has been growing and cultivating cannabis genetics for nearly 4 decades now. This strain is a cross between the classic Critical Krush and an Unknown Ruderalis strain.",
    more_info: "Although this bud is quite Grow-dominant, that wouldn’t be all too apparent from its physical structure. Sure the buds might be shaped like spades, which is typical of Grow flowers, but it is also quite leafy and fluffy which is typical of Sativa flowers. They are often forest or olive green in color, with bright orange hairs wrapping around the exterior of the flower. In addition, you’ll find a fine coating of tiny white and amber trichomes coating much of the surface of the flower. Like the effects provided by this bud, the aroma is quite mellow. Expect sweet pungent hints of earth and peppery lemon to waft out of the jar this flower came in. Likewise, the flavor of the smoke is quite mild, with peppery citrus and earthy lemon flavor coating the throat from any harsh burn.",

In addition, Concord Cream flowers are covered in bright orange pistils that serve as a much needed contrast against the bud’s overall dark appearance. You should expect a not-too-dank aroma to come from these flowers, as it should smell like a bit of fruity grape combined with damp earth and a bit of sweet cream.

This hybrid arose from the growers at Jinxproof Genetics recognizing the need for a strain that provides a lazy and relaxing high without the heavily sedative effects of a pure-Grow strain. Comfortably Dumb is a strain best consumed in the afternoon or evening, as the only thing you’ll want to do after toking on a bit of this flower is lay down and get as comfortable as possible.",

They contain dark purple undertones and sugar leaves, which contrasts with the flower’s incredibly bright orange pistils. These buds are also covered in an incredibly thick layer of milky white trichomes which helps to give the strain even more bag appeal. These nugs produce a skunky aroma that makes for a not-so-discrete operation. You should expect the aroma to erupt out of the packaging as soon as you open it, as waves of fresh pine, jet fuel, sweet fruit, and a bit of skunky diesel will instantly fill the room. Thankfully, the flavor is a bit milder than the aroma which makes for a smooth, fruity and skunky flavor.

The same way that it becomes impossible to get chewing gum out of your hair, Wonka’s Bubblicious contains a thick resin layer which is sure to gunk up your fingers if not your grinder. The aroma produced by these buds seems to explode and fill the room as soon as the buds are broken up. You should expect your place to smell like fruity berries and sweet bubblegum mixed with a bit of skunky diesel. The flavor is incredibly powerful, and likely what got the strain its name.

Unlike its OCA’s Cloud 9 parent strain, Magellan produces a strong aroma of fresh berries mixed with sharp pine and a bit of skunky diesel as they are broken down. When smoking, you’ll taste a pretty strong flavor that consists of a berry overtone with hints of woody earth mixed in.",

This strain is great for getting those creative juices that have been blocked up flowing again. Towards the downturn of the high, consumers report often getting quite relaxed and sometimes even sedated by the powerful body effects. This means you should plan to be in a comfy place during your experience, as you might end up sleeping in the same spot you started your journey.

The team keeps this strain's genetic history a secret, a good move for a proprietary namesake strain like this one. The primary reason consumers and growers are infatuated with this strain is the presence of polyploid flowers, which increase the yield and provides for a unique experience. Nukeheads' ideal consumption time is based on its effects, as sativa-leaning Nukeheads are great for the daytime, while Grow Nukeheads are better saved for the evening.",

It can grow up to fifteen feet tall due to its powerful hybrid genetics in addition to its tendency to grow incredibly thick and supportive stalks. Some growers have measured stalks two-inches thick for plants just under two feet in height, which is definitely overkill for a plant that size. A good way to spot which phenotype is presenting is by looking at the leaves on the plant as it grows. Wide, fat leaves are typical of its Grow phenotype, while thinner leaves are a sign that the Sativa phenotype is presenting. These oversized buds are unique in that they are polyploid, meaning they form as double-headed.

Where these buds are similar is in their flavors, varying only really in sweetness. Typically you’ll find sweet strawberry flavors, a touch of tartness in the citrus overtones, and a heavy candy smell aroma that hits you right away. However, Jack Davis’ Strawberry Snow Cone is fairly sweet with hints of jam while the buds themselves are bright green with pink and yellow hues and crystallized trichomes. The sticky, sweet, yellow-green buds of Elev8 Seeds are chock full of resin that smells of strawberry sour candy and gives a full spectrum of tart and fuel flavors.

Rather than a corruption of 'peanut butter,' as you might expect, its name refers to Puna, a region of the archipelago’s big island of Hawa’i. With such prestigious genetics in its background, it’s no wonder that this legendary strain offers a rich aroma and balanced, long-lasting effects. Puna Budder’s THC content has been measured at between 19% and 22%.",
    more_info: "Puna Budder is known for producing impressively large flowers that adhere in roughly spherical formations; some phenotypes of the strain are more pointed, with spade-like buds. These flowers appear more Grow-influenced on first glance, clinging together tightly in compact and dense buds. The olive green leaves curl tightly inward toward their central stems and are twisted through with brown and orange pistils. Finally, cloudy white trichomes cover the inner and outer nooks and crannies of these nuggets, giving them a very sticky texture and making them difficult to break up without a grinder.",

Blackberry Bubble comes with a mostly laid back, slightly psychedelic high and typically contains only moderate amounts of THC, measured at between 14% and 20%.",
    more_info: "Flowers of Blackberry Bubble tend to be smaller in size, adhering to the dense bud structure typical of many other Grow-dominant varieties. These rounded, pebble-shaped buds are more impressive when it comes to their color -- depending on individual plant phenotype, the flowers’ tightly-curling leaves are various shades of green and purple, with the latter color coming from high concentrations of the pigment anthocyanin. Finally, a sprinkling of icy white trichomes covers these buds, accounting for their psychoactivity.",

Beyond that, this strain’s genetics are unknown and even some of the general statistics about this bud are controversial.",
    more_info: "It’s rumored that The Fork carries a THC level of about 27%, and while this isn’t confirmed directly by the breeders, it makes sense due to her strong effects. What’s more, her nugs are rich in trichomes, bright pistils, and enough resin to make your mouth water. A complex blend of flavors, no doubt due to the legend of her Hawaiian heritage, includes pineapple, berries, earth, and herbs for a delicious toke.",

Typically growing at high, mountainous elevations, these landrace varieties are sativa in nature and offer a complex tropical aroma as well as a surging mental high. While the THC content of South American cannabis can vary, it has been measured at between 10% and 19%.",

These buds are solid at the core, but are composed of long, feathery leaves that twist away from each other at their fringes, resulting in a loose, ragged appearance. The leaves themselves are a mossy green, although occasionally, phenotypes show off patches of pale to dark purple; these surprising hues come about thanks to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which are activated by cold weather. Finally, curly orange pistils and sticky, translucent white trichomes cap off these wild flowers.",

The tightly-spiraling leaves are usually mossy green, threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. Depending on the phenotype, these buds may also be highlighted by varying patches of deep blue and purple. These latter colors come about when high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins in the plant’s genes are stimulated by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. The already-colorful flowers are made even more colorful by a dusting of cloudy white trichomes. This resin also gives the buds a sticky texture and makes them particularly difficult to break up by hand. Purple Dragon also has a dynamic taste to match its visual bag appeal. A tart, fruity aroma wafts up from the buds, likely passed on from grandparent strain Blueberry. Also present is a slight chemical astringency, reminiscent of the gasoline odor of Sour Diesel. When combusted, this strain gives off a very smooth that has notes of musk and hash alongside its fruity palate.

Users should expect to spot incredibly tiny, sticky, off-white trichomes that blanket the surface of the flower. The aroma of produced by these buds is stinky, and quite typical of the classic Haze strains. Expect to scents of tropical fruits and flowers to be interestingly interrupted by harsh bits of kush.

Despite not knowing who first crossed this strain, the community has largely concluded which strains were crossed in order to create Brainwreck. The three strains utilized in Brainwreck’s inception are Trainwreck, Brain Child, and Brain. Although each of these strains on their own are known to be a bit heady and quite powerful, Brainwreck itself is actually quite a mellow strain that is best consumed during the daytime.",
    more_info: "Like most evenly-balanced hybrid strains, the physical aspects of this bud are quite similar to Sativa-dominant buds. These small, piecey nuggets are often shaped like elongated peppers or pinecones. They are often lime or mint green in color with bright orange hairs wrapping around the surface of the bud and adding some bright orange undertones to its facade. Keen eyes will also spot a dense layer of teeny-tiny amber trichomes on the surface of much of the bud. Brainwreck inherits its aroma and flavor from its parents. No sooner than you crack open the bag or jar of this bud, you’ll be hit with a wave of earthy citrus mixed with sweet berries and wood. The aroma flavor is quite similar, though it is a bit more citrus-based with a woody pine aftertaste.",

If you’re growing Biker Kush, it’s recommended to put up some stakes during the flowering period as these oversized buds can bend and break the rubbery-stems of the plant due to their sheer density and weight. The aroma produced by this plant is quite pleasant, as many have described it as smelling exactly like lemon-scented Pine-Sol.

The nugs are covered in a sticky and sparkly resin that gives it a crystal-like appearance. The aromas and flavors are a subtle mixture of flowers, berry, and pine with hints of honey and sage as the smoke lingers.",

Although the lack of inspiration behind this name is astounding, the name itself is still quite descriptive of the properties of this strain. Citral Skunk, according to the numerous reviews available online, produces an aroma so powerful it can only be described as “dank.” This heavy aroma, in addition to its easy-to-grow nature and potent effects, has garnered this strain a number of fans and quite a following in places where it is legal. The THC concentration in these flowers is typically between 16-20%.",

These bright green flowers are almost neon in color, with a number of orangish brown undertones. In addition, you’ll easily spot some winding orange hais and a thick layer of chunky trichomes which can appear amber under the right lighting. These aspects add a lot of bag appeal to the strain, which is important for selling the strain to consumers. The aroma produced by these buds smells super sour, like something decaying in damp musty earth. This smell is only amplified as the buds are broken down or ground up, which makes Citral Skunk a poor choice for stealth smoking. The flavor isn’t nearly as harsh as the aroma, however.

The flowers have somewhat fluffy, wispy leaves that can be tugged off of their central stems. The leaves themselves are forest green and are threaded through with a preponderance of orange hairs (which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from male plants). Certain phenotypes of this strain are also distinguished by shades of purple; these vibrant colors are caused by a high genetic concentration of anthocyanins -- pigments like chlorophyll that turn plants different hues of blue and purple when stimulated by cold temperatures. Parent strain White Widow appears to have passed on its predisposition for resin production, as Candy Cane’s colorful flowers are covered in sticky white trichomes. Candy Cane’s aroma is where its appeal really becomes evident. The cured flowers have a sweet and herbal scent, strikingly similar to the peppermint smell of candy canes. When buds are ground up or combusted, they yield a more spicy scent, similar to the earthy incense bouquet of grandparent strain Afghani. Notably, Candy Cane is lacking in any grape-like smell or taste -- this is because the same pigments that turn its leaves purple do not have a corresponding effect on its taste.",

    info: "The pitbull dog breed has gained an unfair reputations for being dangerous and overly aggressive. The strain of the same name, while very potent, is anything but vicious. It was developed by Stoney Girl Gardens, a group of Portland-based breeders who have created flavorful and locally-themed strains like Marionberry. Pitbull is a cross between P-91 and Stoney Girl’s own sativa Sugar Plum. Though the breeder claims THC levels as high as 36%, independent cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found the bud to have between 10% and 21% THC.",
    more_info: "Pitbull impresses with medium to large-sized nuggets that adhere in a surprisingly loose and fluffy bud structure. The flowers are roughly spade-shaped. Olive green leaves are twisted through with vibrant orange pistils. Occasionally, phenotypes of this strain will show off streaks of purple in their leaves; these hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the plant’s genetics are agitated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Finally, translucent white trichomes cover these buds, giving them a slightly dewy sheen.",

Given Cherries Jubilee’s signature flavor profile and heavy, stoney feeling, though, it feels safe to conjecture that Cherry Kush or Cherry OG lie somewhere in its lineage. Northwest Cannabis Solutions measures this hybrid’s potency at a solid 18% THC.",

The wide leaves themselves are a mossy green and are threaded through with hairy brown to orange pistils. Cloudy white trichomes cover the flowers inside and out, giving them a very sticky texture -- this strain may be difficult to break up without the aid of a quality grinder. As one might expect, the primary aroma of this strain is tart cherries; some sweet berry notes are also mixed in, underscoring the flowers’ bag appeal. Surprisingly for an Grow, Cherries Jubilee has very little underlying skunk or musk. Grinding up or breaking open the buds yields even more of a fruity scent.

The result is a bold and tasty flower that confers lasting Grow relaxation suited to nighttime use. Popular in the Pacific Northwest, Grape Royale has a reported average THC composition of 18%.",

Leaves are mostly a pale sea green. As much as its cousin strain Royal Kush has hints of purple, Grape Royale has even deeper violet hues, thanks to the influence of parent strain Mendocino Purple. This intensified color is thanks to a high concentration of pigments called anthocyanins, which produce blue to purple hues when agitated by cold weather in the growing process. You might expect Grape Royale to have a strong and immediate grape scent, but any fruitiness in the flowers plays second fiddle to a deep hashy funk, inherited from grandparent strains Afghani and Skunk.

In its heyday, Kurple Fantasy was incredibly popular, taking home 2nd place in the High Times Denver Medical Cannabis Cup in 2012. This potent powerhouse combines the potent genetics of Old Man Purps and an OG Kush plant from ‘92! As of 2019 however, this flower has become almost impossible to find, even in its home-state of California. Much to the delight of impatient and insatiable smokers, Imperial Genetics has teased in its Instagram comments that a new batch of Kurple Fantasy seeds might be on the way.",

It is currently unknown if the two plants are the same, or if the name has been used for two different genetic strains. This makes finding solid, reliable information about Kurple Fantasy quite the challenge. Thankfully, you’ve got us!",

G13 bred this strain from Bubblegum Kush and Blueberry, hence the name. It’s one of those rare moments where it smells like it tastes and tastes like you’d expect. For those looking for a balanced high that isn’t too strong or pungent, Blueberry Gum offers a great gateway for novices to get used to the sensation. The inviting flavor gets beginning smokers excited and the lightning-fast growing time making breeders just as happy.",
    more_info: "Breeders notice the super hard nugs right away, like rocky crystal, that give off whiffs of bubblegum when you pull them apart. The plants themselves are low maintenance, making them great for novice growers just getting a taste for their garden. We do recommend you cull the branches to maximize your yield, particularly for the small lower branches that can get pretty thick. The plant in general grows really leafy with a thick blanket of trichomes and amber hairs. As a result, topping is also a good idea. Either way, your yield will be ready in around 55 days, making it one of the fastest flowerers around. Despite these conveniences, Blueberry Gum hasn’t reached the widest audience in legal marijuana markets. This makes it a bit hard to find. If you do though, you’ll be appreciative of the taste and the light sensation.",

    info: "With a name like Venomberry, one might think of this strain as some kind of poison, but this sweet-tasting strain smells of candy and frosty sugary buds. An ancestor to some very old-world Sativas this strain was created by the breeders at Dutch Flowers. Long before they began working on this strain, one of their breeders had found a landrace Uzbekistan Grow. When they began working on Venomberry this Uzbekistan Grow was crossed with a Dutch Flowers strain called Durban Figwidow. The result was much stronger than either parent but the breeders still were not done. In their eyes Venomberry still needed another component to really make it something special and this happened to be Chocolate Thai. After the cross was complete, a particular specimen was chosen and then inbred to stabilize the strain. While Sativa-dominant this strain still retains a mellow body buzz with it's mind numbing cerebral effects.",
    more_info: "This strain grows well indoors and can do well outside in the right conditions, cooler environments will bring out the Uzbekistan causing the stem to turn red and purple. Dark blue-green leaves adorn this strain and the yield of this strain can directly be traced to how much lumen the plant gets. Venomberry should be grown by those with a good deal of experience, requiring two to three weeks of vegetation before flowering for 10 to 11 weeks. Growers have reported up to four ounce yields from this strain. There is also a much lesser seen Grow dominant phenotype that has a slightly shorter flowering time, eight to nine weeks.",

Even though both parents were chosen from the Blueberry line, their differences cause Vanilluna to be more like an F1 hybrid than an in-bred line. The effects of this strain, which has also been deemed Vanilla Moon, are often described as calming and dreamy but most users still retain a sense of clarity.",

These latter hues are the result of anthocyanin pigments in the strain’s genetics that trigger the release of blue and purple shades when stimulated by cold weather. These already-colorful buds are also threaded through with yellow pistils and coated in cloudy white trichomes that account for the strain’s psychoactivity.",

Legend has it that her genetics include Burmese Landrace and Blackseed, and while it was never confirmed in a laboratory setting, she’s measured as high as 75% THC. Hard to find outside of Southern California, Viper City OG is one of a kind.",

Her nugs are a stunning sight to behold featuring blue undertones, nearly clear pistils, and trichomes that are the palest of aqua. Vipers aren’t really known to be very friendly and some might say that this strain’s flavors are similar. A blend of spice, skunk, diesel, and sour fruit all mix as you inhale, often leading to a fair bit of coughing.",

The leaves themselves are a vibrant shade of spring green and are twisted through with brown and orange pistils. Frequently, phenotypes of Super Cheese also boast patches of purple in their leaves; these surprising hues come about when high concentrations of the pigment anthocyanin are stimulated by cold weather during the growing process.

Finally, a thick coating of cloudy, translucent trichomes covers these flowers and make them very difficult to break up without the help of a grinder.",

Lemon Alien Dawg was first created when Alien Genetics crossed a female Alien Dawg plant with Lemon Kush. This strain is known for being one of the parent strains of Starfighter, and incredibly popular Alien Genetics strain whose pure seeds have been sold for upwards of $20,000.",
    more_info: "Lemon Alien Dawg is also known for having great bag appeal as its nugs are quite distinct. This strain is a growers wet dream, as the nugs produced by this plant are nothing short of massive. The yields for these plants indoors are often 10-12 ounces per square meter of plant and 12 ounces or more per plant outdoors. Despite being incredibly Grow in nature, these oversized puffy buds are an unusually light shade of green. The buds themselves are often wrapped in wiry orange pistils and covered in a hearty helping of off-white trichomes. The aroma produced by this bud is pretty loud, and consists of mostly diesel. People used to it will be able to appreciate the aroma, but your upstairs neighbors might not like the smell wafting through the floorboards. The taste is quite unusual, in that it tastes like almost nothing and a bit of citrus lemon. That’s it. Users are often taken by surprise by how smooth the hits are off this flower.",

The plants have a medium maximum growth and the yields are average, flowering in around 63 to 70 days, which is a bit on the long side.

The internal structure of these buds shows clear Grow influences, with the short, broad leaves curling closely inward. The leaves are a pale sage green that is made even paler by the presence of several milky trichomes. Finally, curly orange pistils twist their way through the nooks and crannies of Mighty Glue’s craggy buds.",

However, fluffy nugs are completely coated with thick trichomes, leading us to believe it’s probably somewhere in the 20% zone. A complex flavor and aroma await you, as overtones of chocolate and citrus are complemented by basil and skunk.",

This strain was created by Wonderbrett from Candyland and OZK and exploited for its outrageous, delicious terpene profile. The flavor is floral, chocolate, and minty, an overall deep taste of dessert. The euphoric high brought on by THC levels that can soar as high as 30% gives users a feeling of indestructibility. With the power of nutmeg and Spanish painters, you can do anything.",
    more_info: "Pink Picasso’s terpenes fluidly mix Limonene, Linalool, Myrcene, and Caryophyllene. This provides the strain with zesty citrus-like undertones and hints of rosewood and coriander, which promote anti-inflammation and anti-anxiety (Limonene and Linalool) effects, as well as notes of spicy cinnamon and pepper from the Caryophyllene and Myrcene. The result is a strain that tastes like spicy, floral candy, with hints of chocolate, rose, cinnamon, lavender, nutmeg, and mint.

The strain fans out with plentiful side branches and Sativa-esque leaves -- elegant, thin, and numerous.

This landrace is easily distinguished by its strong stalks which can support heavy production and unique aroma.

Often testing between 21-22% for THC, it also boasts a generous amount of CBD (2%) for a strain that isn't’ bred specifically for CBD content. The resin layer on this flower is so thick some have often called it “gooey” because it gets incredibly viscous and is sure to gunk up your grinder. The aroma produced by these flowers is a unique blend of sweet fruit with earthy pine. The flavor is just a more enhanced version of the aroma which is sure to taste wonderful and not offensive, making this a great strain for those sensitive to smell or taste.

The story goes that during a move, his sister found an Altoid can behind a stove and inside were unknown cannabis seeds that Twompson Praeter grew, thus establishing the strain we know today as Pinkman Goo. The genetics of this plant have remained undisclosed, which makes sense as CaliCropDoc, the company credited with breeding current Pinkman Goo flower wants to keep this incredibly unique bud proprietary. Because Pinkman Goo is a pure Grow strain, it’s best consumed during the afternoon and evening hours when you have a chance to unwind.",
    more_info: "Pinkman Goo buds are incredibly unique; any trained eye can spot them out of a bag of random nugs. This strain has a tree-like ability to ooze sap from all directions, which usually results in an oversized and incredibly distinguished glob of resin on the surface of the flower. Although other plants possess this ability, they’re usually highly unstable and unable to flower a significant amount of bud. To have a stable flower, like Pinkman Goo, on the market is truly unique, these bright, lavender-colored buds often take on pink hues under the right lighting. You’ll certainly spot bits of green, as it contains a number of pretty colors to the delight of just about everyone who spots it. Tiny orange hairs curl around the surface and are often covered in a thick coating of white trichomes. Thankfully this strain isn’t too stinky, ideal for situations where discretion is key, smelling of earthy flowers with a twist of that classic cannabis stank. The flavor is quite similar, but the sweet floral flavors are slightly more potent than the musky earth tones.",

The product of this cross offered a number of benefits over both of its parent strains such as higher yields, better spacing in the plant, and a complex flavor that few strains have been able to achieve. Thus, Dynasty Genetics found itself with a powerful strain that only they had their hands on. This strain is best consumed as day turns to night when you don’t have any responsibilities left and you’re just looking to relax.",

Some report that the trichomes are amber under the right light, which only serves to enhance its visual appeal. The aroma is quite spicy, though not nearly as pungent as some of the other strains in this family tree. You should expect to smell a variety of herbs and floral scents on top of fresh menthol and some berries. The flavor is a mix of nutty vanilla and fruity berries with a sharp, minty-menthol exhale.

Only dispensaries confirmed by the breeder are allowed to sell Mango Brulee.

Continue reading if you want to learn more about this depression-evaporating, colorful plant.",
    more_info: "Mango Brulee’s effects start very slowly – this strain is a classic creeper. The buds come in dark green with dark, amber-colored pistils and an even coating of tiny white-yellow trichomes. As you roll the nugs in your hands, you’ll get whiffs of sour tanginess, like a combination of citrus and tropical mangoes. You may also detect Pinene, one of the strain’s dominant terpenes, which comes out in a scent of mountain trees that we think adds to the strain’s therapeutic value. Users experienced with the Banana Pudding strain know basically what to expect from Mango Brulee.",

This is probably why their kid, OZ Kush, rarely makes it into the 20s in terms of THC. Despite this, OZ Kush uses what it’s got, laying on a thick serving of relaxation to give its users a sedating, heavy high. The strain is warm and reassuring. It comes at you in sleepy waves, encouraging you to take it easy and sleep, like a comforting friend in cannabis form.",
    more_info: "In around 9 to 11 weeks on average, OZ Kush begins to flower, around October if you’re cultivating it outdoors. You may notice that this is long for a Kush strain. The Silver Haze genes probably prolong it a bit, but you’ll forgive your plants when the mid-sized growing structure begins putting out its neon green product. The strain grows in hard, reinforced clumps, bright green and speckled with thin, yellow pistils. It can be cultivated inside or outside and always produces a medium-sized yield.",

The high starts as a light tingle, almost like your head is spinning, and you’ll feel cerebral pressure as it lifts you up.

Odd naming conventions aside, Cookie Puss is a wonderfully powerful and flavorful strain of cannabis that should be on the top of every stoner’s “must have” list when they walk in the dispensary.

A hearty coating of off-white crystal trichomes cover the surface of this bud and can appear pink in color under the correct lighting. These flowers produce an incredibly pungent aroma that smells of damp earth, diesel, and some light but sharp citrus. The flavor is quite similar, you should expect to taste a wonderful blend of sweet lemon, tart lime, and a bit of that classic sour diesel flavor.

In Canada, this strain has often been available as the cheap commercial marijuana referred to as 'Beasters.' Originally bred by the Super Sativa Seeds Club, M-39 was listed as a cross of Basic #5 and Skunk #1.

If you can handle a little mystery (and a lot of citrus), continue reading to learn what you’re in for when you take a trip to Malibu OG.",

Plants that contain a good amount of Limonene include rosemary, mint, and pine, so you can expect your Malibu OG bud to echo them, particularly the longer you smoke. The strain includes other terpenes, of course, which bring more tropical and floral tastes to the mix like the flavors of pineapple and hibiscus.

If the look of these beautiful buds isn’t enough to entice you to take a hit, the aroma will have you flicking a lighter before you realize it. The smell from El Chapo is quite unique as well. Many have reported an intense combination of sweet lemon, fresh pine, pungent skunk, musty earth, and flowery kush. In addition, the flavor and quality of smoke produced by El Chapo OG is insane.

From its famous parents, Tropicana Cookies and Trophy Wife, Point Break manages to soothe and sedate its users with a slightly Grow-dominant structure and a THC level that hovers in the low-mid 20s. For more about what to expect from the cannabis version of an action classic, keep reading.",

Believe it or not, this plant captures the flavors that her name entails with surprising accuracy, offering users a bold hit of citrus, dragonfruit, and herbs with each inhale. As nugs burn, a similar aroma is released along with an earthy quality that balances things out nicely.",

When you open your bag and begin pulling these nugs apart, you’ll be met with the scent of apple cider and musky berries. The combination of sour and sweet is mixed with a smell of cheese, pungent spice and citrus. The flavor that lingers on your palette is like a tart apple mixed with a creamy, cheesy flavor, almost like vanilla yogurt, with hints of mint and gas. The total flavor palette is mind-altering but somewhat expected if you have any experience with Triangle Mints or Apple Fritter.",

They are female-owned, family-operated, and have been growing cannabis out of Oregon since 2013. Horchata is a baby they made from crossing Jet Fuel Gelato and Mochi Gelato, which explodes in a unique flavor of sweetness, creaminess, and spice. It’s named for a sweet drink that originated in Mexico, made from soaked cinnamon sticks blended into water and thickened with milk, rice, and almonds. The Horchata strain takes that profile and extends it with notes of berries and spice. If you’re looking for something unique, you might want to partake of Horchata. Do it with a little meraki.",

Spec Ops inherited their sedative effects as well as an earthy aftertaste. The plant’s harvest time has a wide range (56 to 70 days) and a bit of a temperamental growing structure that we recommend managing closely with ample pruning.

This cannabis operation, located in Mendocino County, CA, excels in both indoor and outdoor grows, giving consumers the best of both worlds. In order to create this potent hybrid strain, Rick crossed the ever-popular Sour Diesel sativa plant with Buzz Bomb, resulting in a wonderfully aromatic and potent bud he named Purple Killer. Purple Killer is a wonderful daytime smoke as it will leave you energetic and uplifted with its average THC concentration of 20%.",
    more_info: "Despite the name Purple Killer, these airy buds are often mint-green in color. Though some harvests have produced incredibly deep purple buds, this is likely because of cold indoor grow conditions producing purple buds. These spade-shaped nugs contain bright purple undertones, winding orange hairs, and a thick layer of off-white trichomes that take on a slightly lavender color.",

First, they crossed Jack Herer and Purple Afghan Kush, and subsequently crossing the result of this first cross with Moby Dick. The result was an incredibly potent and high yielding plant that they named Purple Moby Dick. This strain makes for a lovely daytime smoke, averaging 18% THC.",

Sour Lemons is a not-so-well-known hybrid attributed to the illustrious Denver-based cannabis company Dark Horse Genetics. You might have heard of this company before, as they’re responsible for creating a number of stunning hybrid strains in addition to being the company who first bred Bruce Banner. Not much is known about Sour Lemons, unfortunately, as most confuse the name with another similar strain, Sour Lemons OG. We do know that this slightly heady high is best experienced during the daytime, though the average THC remains a mystery. A singular test data on this strain exists to the public, showing the strain tested for 16% THC, though we don’t know if this is a high, low, or an average of the strain’s possible THC values.",
    more_info: "Sour Lemons buds are medium-sized, deep-green morsels of cannabis. They almost resemble limes in shape and color, though they are also covered in winding orange hairs and a thick layer of white trichomes. They produce, as the name suggests, a citrus aroma with a bit of musky earth and sharp herbs. The flavor is similar, with the added sour kick of citrus on the exhale which makes for a tasty experience. According to Dark Horse Genetics, this bud flowers in just 9 weeks, making it somewhat viable commercially.",

Growers love how hardy the plant is and users love the taste, which has a calming tea flavor with a little spicy aftertaste, a welcoming flavor for novices concerned about getting used to the skunkiness of other strains. Its effects bring on classic symptoms, complete with a warm sense of calm and an addicting bout of the munchies.",

The sprouts come later than most strains, bringing the total growing time up to around 70 days, a little longer than average. However, you can expect this strain from Sativa Seedbank (they bred it from Afghani Landrace and North African Landrace strains) to produce 450 grams per square meter. The plants are strong, so you won’t likely lose any either. It also needs less vegetating than most strains.",

If you get Trinidad on the low end, you could be experiencing a strain with 18% THC, which is nothing to complain about, especially for beginners. However, if you get prime, maximum potency Trinidad OG, you’ll have a bud that contains a mind-altering amount of THC, up to 32%! Chronic conditions, including depression, can’t stand up against those powerhouse, mind-melting levels. If it can, you should probably have that checked out.",

Continue reading to learn what’ll happen if you decide to shoot your brain with a full dose of Bazookies.",
    more_info: "The strain’s terpene profile favors Beta-Caryophyllene, Beta-Myrcene, and Terpinolene. This gives the strain its sweet woody flavors mixed with the aroma of bubble gum candy. It’s sweet and outdoorsy, like fruit-flavored gum mixed with piney, woody flavors, almost like the flavor of a sweet tomato or earthy apple. With a little skunk on the aftertaste, almost a grassy flavor, Bazookies is like taking a big deep breath of the countryside. The THC is low, around 12% on average, which should help new cannabis consumers ease themselves into this fragrant strain. We’re happy to report that it’s easy to grow as well, flowering in around 60 days without much trouble (prepare for a mid-October harvest when grown outside).",
