    info: "With LED grow lights, you will generally get better results with many smaller LED panels, as opposed to a few big LED panels. For example, you will often get better results with 2 x 125W LEDs (total 250W) than you would with a single LED model that produces 250W. This is because more panels often make it easier for you to spread the light to where it’s needed.",

    info: "At this size it starts going outside the scope of a “hobbyist” grower as far as ease and yields. In addition to needing a lot of extra cooling, a 1000W grow light is less efficient compared to a 600W grow light (as far as how much light is put out for electricity used). Most hobbyist growers would be happier with a 600W, or even two 600W lights, over a 1000W.",
