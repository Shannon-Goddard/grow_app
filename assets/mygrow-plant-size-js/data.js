    info: "Some people put their seedlings or clones right into the flowering stage if they want to harvest quickly though this makes for extremely small plants. It’s also important to remember that container size makes a big difference. Small containers constrain the roots and keep plants from getting as big as they could. For every foot tall you want your plant to be, the container should be eqal in gallon; 1 foot tall plant would need 1 gallon container.",

    info: "A too-tall plant isn’t a big deal if it fits in your grow space, but the extra lower growth that doesn’t produce bud is essentially a waste of electricity, time and money, since you potentially could have shaved weeks off your vegetative stage without sacrificing yields! 3-gallon pots tend to produce mid-size plants",

So make sure you end the vegetative stage before your plant reaches half the final height you want, or your cannabis plants may outgrow your grow space during the flowering stage! 5 gallon container",

    info: "Due to the space needed from the ceiling to the exhaust, the exhaust from the light, and the light from your plant... Your cannabis plants WILL outgrow your grow space during the flowering stage! Unless you plan on using High-Stress Training (HST). I would recommend growing outside. Many growers begin germinating seeds as early as February and March in order to have big plants come harvest. You want to plant your plants in the ground outside, no later than, early to mid-May",
